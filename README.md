# [SlitherScale](https://www.slitherscale.com)

This is a simple SPA, built on [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev), to let users measure snakes (or anything, technically) by using a photo with a reference object for scale. Inspired by [Serpwidgets](https://serpwidgets.com), which went down in January, 2025.

All images are kept entirely on-device and not uploaded anywhere.

## Running locally

```shell
npm i
npm run dev
```
